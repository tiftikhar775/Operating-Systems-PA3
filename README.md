# Operating-Systems-PA3
My third out of three programming assignments from my Operating Systems class at the University of Houston

Objective:
This assignment will introduce you to interprocess synchronization mechanisms in UNIX using named POSIX semaphores, pthread mutex semaphores, and pthread condition variables.



Problem:


For this assignment, you will modify your solution for programming assignment 1 to comply with the restrictions explained below.

Given a message (string or char array) as input, you need to implement a multithreaded version of the Shannon-Fano-Elias code generator based on the following steps:

Read the input from STDIN (the Moodle server will implement input redirection to send the information from a file to STDIN). The input has a single line with the message  (string or char array).
Example Input File: AAAAAABBBBBCCCCDDDEE

Create n POSIX threads (where n is the number of symbols to encode). Each child thread executes the following tasks:
Receives the probabilities of the symbols from the main thread.
Implements the Shannon-Fano-Elias encoding algorithm to determine the code for the assigned symbol.
Print the Shannon-Fano-Elias code for the assigned symbol. 
Given the previous input, the expected output is:

SHANNON-FANO-ELIAS Codes:

Symbol A, Code: 001
Symbol B, Code: 011
Symbol C, Code: 1010
Symbol D, Code: 1101
Symbol E, Code: 11110
NOTES:

You can safely assume that the input files will always be in the proper format.
You cannot use global variables. A 100% penalty will be applied to submissions using global variables. 
You must define the critical sections following the guidelines that we discussed in class.
You must use POSIX threads. A penalty of 100% will be applied to submissions using a thread library other than the pthread library.
You can only use named POSIX semaphores, pthreads mutex semaphores, or pthreads condition variables to achieve synchronization. Using pthread_join or sleep to synchronize your threads is not allowed (you must use pthread_join to guarantee that the parent thread waits for all its child threads to end before ending its execution). A penalty of 100% will be applied to submissions using the previous system calls to synchronize the child threads.
You cannot use different memory addresses to pass the information from the parent thread to the child threads.
You must use the output statement format based on the example above.
